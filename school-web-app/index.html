	<p>Technology has become an indispensable part of our lives, and in
		fact we have become addicted to technology. This may give the
		impression that we are now in command of technology and science more
		than ever before. But how accurate is it? There is a danger pertinent
		to technology addiction: it may limit thinking, invention, and
		creativity, and eventually weaken the power of science and technology
		production.</p>
	<hr>
	<p>Thus, the mission of a faculty of engineering should be to
		transform our youth from technology users to technology creators in
		the vast ocean of technology. Engineers we foster must know that at
		least half of the knowledge and skills they need to create the mobile
		phone they hold in their hands actually rests in their own minds.</p>
